## 1. Project Description
Our project is for people who require extra motivation to study and those who want to partake in building good study habits in a collaborative matter. Users will be able to use the pomodoro timer and then be able to share their study stats with others. We will store user profiles i.e. status (occupation/student/school), things they are studying for/working on, their studying stats, and brief info about the user. Users will be able to share their studying stats with other users on the app and comment on progress towards each others goals. For stretch goals, we will consider implementing a live pomodoro timer (shared sessions) and voice chat and/or video calling, if time permits.

## 4. Description of Above and Beyond functionality
For our pomodoro app, we have went above and beyond to achieve app responsiveness. For example, in the Statistics page, the pomodoro statistics cards and the statistics calendar adjust accordingly in response to the width of the browser for enhanced user experience. In addition, we have implemented the toggle feature for users to enable various toggle modes, specifically default, slate, and light green. The different color schemas will allow users to customize and choose a specific thematic background to their preference across all the pages of the app.

## 5. Description of Next Steps
For next steps, we would like to add the functionality of adding and connecting with friends for pomodoro sessions and provide the additional social aspect to the application. Furthermore, we would like to further improve the app by including the feature for users to create custom pomodoro groups and invite other users/friends to join for collaborative study sessions.
