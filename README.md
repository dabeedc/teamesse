## Project Description
Our project is for people who require extra motivation to study and those who want to partake in building good study habits in a collaborative matter. Users will be able to use the pomodoro timer and then be able to share their study stats with others. We will store user profiles i.e. status (occupation/student/school), things they are studying for/working on, their studying stats, and brief info about the user. Users will be able to share their studying stats with other users on the app and comment on progress towards each others goals. Live pomodoro timer (shared sessions) and perhaps in the future voice chat and/or video calling, if time permits.
